I am a graduate student at the [Center for Advanced Medical Computing and Analysis (CAMCA)](https://camca.mgh.harvard.edu/), working with [Professor Quanzheng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MHq2z7oAAAAJ) and [Professor Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). My research investigates the development and application of large-scale machine learning models for biomedical data analysis, with a primary focus on medical imaging.
