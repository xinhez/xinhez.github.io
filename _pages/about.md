<!-- I am a graduate student at the [Center for Advanced Medical Computing and Analysis (CAMCA)](https://camca.mgh.harvard.edu/), working with [Professor Quanzheng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MHq2z7oAAAAJ) and [Professor Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). My research investigates the development and application of large-scale machine learning models for biomedical data analysis, with a primary focus on medical imaging. -->

I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. My research focuses on large-scale machine learning methods for biomedical data analysis, with an emphasis on medical imaging. I am primarily based at Massachusetts General Hospital.

I received my undergraduate and master’s training in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to my graduate training at Harvard, I gained broad industry experience in software engineering and applied machine learning at Google, Facebook (Meta), Duolingo, and JPMorgan Chase, as well as healthcare technology experience at a clinical neuroscience hospital. These experiences reflect a sustained interest in translating research into real-world impact.

When I am not working, I hunt for the best freshly roasted coffee beans in the greater Boston area. You might also find me catching a show at Central Square Theater or the Huntington Theatre.
